                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a curious and impact-driven individual who thrives at the intersection of problem-solving, 
                    innovation, and human connection. As a Computer Science student at the National University of 
                    Singapore, specializing in Algorithms & Theory, as well as Artificial Intelligence, I have 
                    developed a strong technical foundation while fostering a deep passion for community engagement 
                    and leadership. My background in full-stack development and collaborative project-building has 
                    shaped me into someone who places equal value upon both technical excellence and real-world 
                    application.
                    <br><br>    
                    From a young age, I have been drawn to the challenge of answering the endless ‘hows’ and ‘whys’ 
                    that fuel my curiosity for mathematics and problem-solving. However, what excites me most is tackling 
                    these challenges alongside like-minded individuals, discussing new ideas, iterating on solutions, and 
                    constantly pushing the boundaries of what we can build. Beyond work and academics, I find peace in 
                    volunteering, regular exercise, and deliberate self-reflection, which help me stay grounded and aligned 
                    with my long-term aspirations of creating positive change in the world.
